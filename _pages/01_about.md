I began my career at Cal in 2005 and, after spending two years at the Economics Department of [New York University](http://econ.as.nyu.edu/page/home), returned in the Fall of 2011.

I am an econometrician with research interests in network formation, the identification of peer group effects, panel data and missing data problems (including those related to causal inference). My research has appeared in a variety of journals, including _Econometrica_ and the _Review of Economic Studies_. I am currently a co-editor at the [_Review of Economics and Statistics_](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/rest).

At Berkeley I teach econometrics at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. A full CV in pdf format is available [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl}}/downloads/cv_BSG.pdf).
